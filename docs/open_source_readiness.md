# Open-source readiness

Before publishing or tagging a release:

1. Run tests and ensure they pass.
2. Run the publishability scan across the intended distribution tree.
3. Confirm examples and fixtures are synthetic.
4. Confirm no runtime caches or build artifacts are committed.
5. Confirm `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` are correct.
6. Build and verify a release bundle and keep the manifest with the archive.
