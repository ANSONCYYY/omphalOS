# Provenance

Provenance in omphalOS is expressed through three artifacts:

- **run manifest**: indexes artifacts and fingerprints
- **lineage stream**: step-level input/output attribution
- **evidence packets**: reviewer-facing objects that combine claims, evidence, and explanations

The workbench is designed so that provenance travels with a run directory and can be verified without external systems.
