# Security

## Reporting

If you believe you have found a security issue, do not open a public issue.

Instead, report it privately to the maintainers using the security contact mechanism described in the repository settings.
Include:

- a clear description
- steps to reproduce
- affected files or commands
- any relevant logs (redact secrets)

## Response

Reports are acknowledged promptly and triaged based on impact and exploitability.
Fixes are released with a security note in the changelog when appropriate.
